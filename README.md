     During the gameplay, you are required to enter the coordinate (row number and column number) to shoot at the enemy board.
     ◦ If you get into a hidden enemy ship, then this place is marked with an "X" and you are given the opportunity to shoot again
     ◦ If you miss (shoot at an empty cell), then this place is marked with a "T" sign
     ◦ If you have already shot at this cell, then you are given a chance to shoot again
                           The game ends when all the ships (yours or AI's) are destroyed
