                       The code was created to be able to play the Battleship game in the console.
                           (If the game didn't start the first time, try to start it again)

 During the gameplay, you are required to enter the coordinate (row number and column number) to shoot at the enemy board.
 ◦ If you get into a hidden enemy ship, then this place is marked with an "X" and you are given the opportunity to shoot again
 ◦ If you miss (shoot at an empty cell), then this place is marked with a "T" sign
 ◦ If you have already shot at this cell, then you are given a chance to shoot again
 The game ends when all the ships (yours or AI's) are destroyed
